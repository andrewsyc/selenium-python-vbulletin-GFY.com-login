# selenium-python-vbulletin-GFY.com-login
Allows browser and profile scrape of gfy.com website


# GFY.com profile scraper

## This script will bot the profiles on GFY.com
  - This script will take well over a week to run. 
  - Just under 400k profiles on GFY

## Why did I write this?
> The purpose of this script is sentimental, I was going to mine the profiles for user posts and how long someone had been logging in over the years (GFY tenure). Adult (porn) like any website has had a lot of ups and downs over the years and this is one way to infer how the state of things has matured.
  

### Dependencies
- BeautifulSoup4 for Python 2.7
- Python 2.7
- Firefox web browser
- Selenium web driver suite to control the browser


Issues:
> When the browser opens click on firefox until the profile being logged into is successfully logged in. Occasionally the profile may not correctly fill out if the mouse cursor is doing other things on the computer. I'm not quite sure what this issue is but only a minor one to deal with at the start of the script. 

## Run Command

#### python gfy_profile.py
